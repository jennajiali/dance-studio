<!-- This template displays the attendance history for a specific student. -->
<!-- It shows the student's name and membership number, and lists their attendance records in a table. -->
<!-- If there are no records, it informs the user that no attendance records were found. -->
<!-- The template also includes a link to return to the home page. -->
<!-- Note: Ensure that the 'base.html' template exists and contains the necessary HTML structure. -->
<!-- The 'attendance_records' variable should be passed from the view, containing the attendance data for the student. -->
<!-- The 'student' variable should also be passed from the view, containing the student's details. -->
<!-- The 'url' tag is used to generate the URL for the 'index' view, allowing easy navigation back to the home page. -->

<!-- Ensure that the 'attendance_records' variable is a list of attendance records for the student, -->
<!-- and that each record has 'date', 'time', and 'dance_class' attributes. -->
<!-- The 'dance_class' attribute should have a 'name' attribute to display the class name in the table. -->
